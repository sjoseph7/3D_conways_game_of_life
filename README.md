## \*3D\* Conway's Game of Life

After building a [2D Conway's Game of Life](https://github.com/sjoseph520/conways_game_of_life), I wondered what a 3D version would look like... so I built [this](https://sjoseph7-3d-conways-game-of-life.netlify.app/).

The board is a 7x7x7 grid (mostly because that's the most my laptop could handle ðŸ˜…). The original Conway's Game of Life rules don't work as well in 3D space, so after some experimentation I made my own that make for interesting visualizations (that don't immediately collapse) in a 7x7x7 grid.

3D Rules:

- If cell is alive and has `fewer than 7 neighbors` or `more than 9 neighbors`, it lives; otherwise it dies.
- If a cell is dead but has `exactly 4 or 10 neighbors`, it is 'revived'; otherwise, it stays dead.

I also have a 2D version: ([link](https://github.com/sjoseph7/conways_game_of_life)) ([site](https://sjoseph7-conways-game-of-life.netlify.app/))
